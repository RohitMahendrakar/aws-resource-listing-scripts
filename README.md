# DevOps Script Project

This repository contains scripts and configurations for automating AWS resource listing using CLI commands and scheduling tasks using Cron. The project demonstrates basic DevOps practices such as automation with scripts, scheduling tasks, and logging.

## Project Overview

This project automates the process of listing AWS resources using AWS CLI and displays the results in a human-readable format. It also sets up a cron job to run the script on a regular basis. The key commands used include:

- `aws configure`
- `aws s3 ls`
- `aws ec2 describe-instances`
- `aws lambda list-instances`
- `aws iam list-users`

The script uses `jq` for JSON parsing and `yq` for YAML parsing. It also integrates with `cron` to run the script at scheduled intervals.

## Prerequisites

Before using the scripts, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **AWS CLI**: Configure AWS CLI with your credentials.
- **jq**: JSON parser for handling AWS CLI JSON outputs.
- **yq**: YAML parser for parsing YAML output.
- **Crontab**: To schedule the script execution at specific times.

To install `jq` and `yq`:

```bash
sudo yum install jq
sudo yum install yq
